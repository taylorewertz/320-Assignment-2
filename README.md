Prog2_1.sh
    The user is given files to search through using bash, we search through the files using grep looking for perfect scores in the file we were given. The user looks for perfect scores using grep and matches a name with those perfect scores, then with the name using grep we find a password and a user name then prints them to standard out. to compile this program the user will need to enter two command line arguments and in the terminal the user will enter prog2_1.sh FILENAME FILENAME with FILENAME being the actual name  of the file to be searched and the program will run.
    
Prog2_2.sh
    The user is given a repository to search through using bash, using grep the user is prompted to find four c programs in a messy set of files. When the files are found using grep the user needs the names of the files printed out with the extension .c tacked on the back of them then prints the assignment files to standard out. To run this program the user will need to have one command line argument added, to run the program the user will enter ./prog2_2.sh FILENAME with FILENAME being the actual file name, then the program will run.
